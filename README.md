### For Task 1: Infographic Comparison

- Goals:
1. **Evaluate**:
   - **Assessment**: When you evaluate data in visualization, you are primarily focused on assessing the characteristics, patterns, and details within a single dataset or a single visualization.
   - **Single Entity**: It involves examining the data within a single chart, graph, or visualization to understand its inherent properties. You're not necessarily comparing it to other datasets or visualizations.
   - **Examples**: An evaluation might involve looking at a line chart of a company's sales over time to determine if there's a seasonal pattern or examining a histogram to understand the distribution of ages in a population.

2. **Compare**:
   - **Comparison**: When you compare data in visualization, you are primarily concerned with contrasting and finding relationships or differences between two or more datasets or visualizations.
   - **Multiple Entities**: It involves looking at multiple charts, graphs, or visualizations side by side or overlaying them to identify commonalities, differences, or trends across these datasets.
   - **Examples**: Comparing two line charts representing the sales of two competing products to see which one is performing better, or comparing two scatter plots to understand if there's a correlation between two variables in different datasets.
   

1. **Evaluate and Compare Two Different Infographics**:
   - 2 different infographics on the same subject - Water Consumption

**Inferences:**

**Tourism Expenditure Comparison: Iceland vs. India (2018-2020)**
- Iceland had significantly lower tourism expenditure compared to India in all three years.
- Both countries experienced fluctuations in tourism expenditure over these years.
- The year 2020 saw a significant decrease in tourism expenditure for both countries, which could be attributed to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries experienced a decline in tourism during this period due to travel restrictions and safety concerns.
- India had much higher tourism expenditure compared to Iceland, indicating that India is a larger and more popular tourist destination in terms of expenditure.
- The disparities in tourism expenditure between the two countries may reflect differences in their economies, tourism infrastructure, and marketing efforts.

**GDP per capita for Iceland and India over the years 1995 to 2020**
- Over this period, both Iceland and India have experienced growth in their GDP per capita. However, the growth rate in Iceland is significantly higher compared to India.
- Iceland consistently has a much higher GDP per capita compared to India throughout the entire period. This suggests that Iceland is a high-income country, while India falls in the lower-income category.
- The data highlights the significant economic disparities between these two countries. Iceland's GDP per capita is substantially higher, indicating a higher standard of living and greater economic development.
- While India's GDP per capita is lower than Iceland's, it shows a steady upward trend. This indicates that India's economy has been growing, albeit at a slower pace than Iceland.
- It's worth noting that certain global events or economic crises (not mentioned in the data) could have influenced the GDP per capita trends in both countries. For example, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 may have had an impact on these figures.
- Iceland's remarkable recovery from the 2008 financial crisis is evident in the data, as its GDP per capita increased significantly in the years following the crisis.
- India's GDP per capita shows consistent growth, which aligns with its status as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.
- Both countries experience fluctuations in GDP per capita from year to year, which can be influenced by various factors, including economic policies, global economic conditions, and domestic factors.

**Currency Chronicles: Iceland vs. India (1995-2021)**
- Iceland's exchange rate has been relatively stable over the years, with some fluctuations. In contrast, India has seen more significant fluctuations in its exchange rate during the same period.
- The Icelandic Krona (ISK) has a higher exchange rate compared to the Indian Rupee (INR). This indicates that one ISK has historically been worth more than one INR.
- Exchange rates are influenced by various economic factors. The data suggests that Iceland may have had more economic stability or control over its currency compared to India during this period.
- Significant events, such as economic crises or global economic trends, may have influenced exchange rates differently in both countries. Further analysis would be needed to understand the specific factors behind these fluctuations.
- Exchange rates can also be influenced by investment and trade activities. It's possible that Iceland's smaller economy and different trade relationships contributed to its exchange rate stability compared to India.
- Government policies, including monetary and fiscal measures, can impact exchange rates. Iceland and India may have implemented different policies during this period that affected their exchange rates.

**GDP vs. Exchange Rate (2005-2015)**
- Iceland's exchange rate showed an increasing trend from 2005 to 2015, indicating a strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the US Dollar.
- India's exchange rate also showed an increasing trend over the same period, but with some fluctuations.
- Iceland had a significantly higher GDP per capita compared to India in all years.
- Both countries saw an increase in GDP per capita from 2005 to 2015, with Iceland experiencing fluctuations in between.
